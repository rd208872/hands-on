This documentation gives complete information about HDFS Commands:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

HDFS User Commands are:
1. fs / dfs
2. archive
3. distcp

HDFS Admin Commands are:
1. namenode -format
2. namenode
3. secondarynamenode
4. datanode
5. dfsadmin
6. fsck


Generic commands : - Not mandatory , this is required to customize command run time environment

Steps to practice 
====================
Try like below 

> hadoop fs -help copyFromLocal
> hadoop fs -usage copyFromLocal (you will get notation / structure of the command ) [ help to avoid any format issue , space issue , case sensitivity issue etc..)


Shell scripts
-----------------
1. Hadoop
2. hdfs
3. mapred
4. yarn 

We will first cover hadoop and hdfs shell script 

> fs â€“ Generic Filesystem Client
> dfs - Distributed File system client

Facts about HDFS:
-----------------
In HDFS, the data is organized as blocks, blocks are stored in replicated fashion across data nodes.
In HDFS, the default block replication is 3 i.e., thre different data nodes.
HDFS build on Linux , so it behaves Linux like file system through its POSIX capabilities.
In HDFS, File system starts with root i.e., "/".
In HDFS, every user has home directory like linux HOME i.e., /user/$USER or /user/username.
After connecting to terminal , you will get username@hostname .
In HDFS, directory is empty file and replication factor is not applicable.
In HDFS, every file & directory has file permissions to restict the data access.
HDFS file system protocol is hdfs://
HDFS consider Linux users and groups.

fs/dfs is the command to execute file system operations like directory creation, renaming files,copying files, removing, displaying files, etc. It offers several command options, some of them are below

fs is associated with hadoop shell script whereas dfs is associated with hdfs shell script. Both have a bunch of command options.
dfs can use uses in case of generic/ tradional file system whereas fs cannot compatible with distributed filesystem .

commands
==============
a. help - to get the command option description
b. usage - get the command option usage
-------------------------------------------------------
ls - listing files/dirs

mkdir - directory creation

put, copyFromLocal - load file from local system to HDFS

moveFromLocal	- move file from local system to HDFS

appendToFile -- append the file with another file in HDFS.

cat - to print the HDFS file data over console.

moveToLocal - This is not implemented.

copyToLocal - to get files from HDFS to Local

count - to get file/dir count, quota info, path & size details.

du - disk utilization

df - disk free

cp/mv - copy/move files from HDFS to HDFS.

rmdir/rm - rmdir used to delete empty directory where rm is used to delete files and directories.

get, getmerge - to get files from HDFS to Local

checksum - to dump file checksum

find - to find the specific file/dir in a specified path.

tail - to get the last 1kb of the file.

setrep - to alter replication of file/dir.

touchz - to create empty file.

truncate - to truncate the data to a particular length.

chmod, chgrp, chown - to change permissions, owner, group of file/dir.
